# IMUcalib
CalibROVER is a ROS2-based calibration tool designed for 4-wheel drive robots operating in planar environments. It accurately estimates IMU installation deviations—including positional offsets (dx, dy) and angular misalignments (roll, pitch, yaw)—relative to the robot's center (base_link).
